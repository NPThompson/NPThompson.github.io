<p>	Programming is fascinating and useful, but very confusing for the beginner. This tutorial is designed to help the neophyte programmer choose his first language. To do so, it provides some history of programming languages and practical advice derived from the experience of the author.</p>

<p>	No, but they complement each other well. Both are abstract. But while Math studies static, absolute truths in the form of equations, Code guides processes, which evolve over time. Knowing either one will help you learn the other, but to start coding, you only need to know basic arithmetic. Code can be less abstract than math, which makes it easier to learn. The proof of a program is that it works, which anyone can see, but the proof of a theorem is just as abstract as the theorem it proved.</p>

<p>	Both are pedantic. That is, unlike literary criticism or gender studies, here words have precise meanings. You'll need to learn to make very subtle distinctions, and follow long trains of thought with exacting precision. It's exhausting and confusing at first, and mistakes are common. Most mistakes will be caught by the interpreter of your language, which will tell you what you did wrong and where, allowing you to fix it. The truly frustrating errors are called bugs: errors which neither you nor the computer are aware of. A bug causes what we call in the vernacular 'undefined behavior'.</p>

<h1><a name="Languages and Paradigms">Languages and Paradigms</a></h1>
<h1><a name=""></a></h1>
<p>	You may be surprised to discover just how 'hands-on' coding is. There is a lot of theory involved, but the skill itself is practical, even experimental. The best way to learn is to pick a programming language and start practicing it. Sixty years ago that wouldn't have been a hard choice: there were just a handful of languages to choose from. But since then the languages have multiplied and mutated, until now there are literally hundreds of them.  </p>
<h1><a name=""></a></h1>
<p>	Just like how your natural language( english, korean, or whatever the case may be ) has become an almost perfect reflection of your thought, so too will your programming language. But languages do not just reflect our thoughts, they influence them. You will find that Programming languages will shape how you think about programs. This is what we call the 'paradigm' of the language. </p>
<h1><a name=""></a></h1>
<p>	The machine itself 'speaks' machine code, which varies according to the specific machine you're talking to, but in general thinks in terms of shuffling bits around and twiddling their values. Initially, programmers wrote their programs in machine code. But our programs quickly exhausted our ability to comprehend them. So programmers came up with new ideas( or borrowed old ones ) to organize their programs, and wove the ideas directly into the syntax of new languages.</p>
<h1><a name=""></a></h1>
<p>	The new languages, built out of machine code, form an interface between the machine and the programmer. The interpreter of the language translates the higher-level language into machine code form, so that the programmer can ignore details which are irrelevant to his problem. The techniques which the language supports for suppressing detail and phrase the problem inevitably form a paradigm.</p>
<h1><a name=""></a></h1>
<p>	The clearly distinct paradigms are Functional, Imperative, Logical, and Object-Oriented. Most programming languages tend to favor one paradigm over another, though they typically support features from a mix of paradigms. Actually Logical is pretty hard to combine with other paradigms, but I digress. Most coders have their own favorite language or paradigm, and flame wars over which one is best are not unheard-of. My own opinion is that the functional paradigm is typically the best, but in those cases when it is not, you need a language with only a few, simple ideas and some ability to modify itself, so that it can be adapted to that paradigm. </p>

<h1><a name=""></a></h1>
<p>	<a href="LISP101.html">LISP</a>, to me, is far and away the best choice for a beginner's language. It has a mathematical simplicity that makes it easy to start using, and yet profound and powerful when you fully understand it. As I hinted earlier, LISP has a capacity for modifying itself, and is unique among programming languages for this.</p>
<h1><a name=""></a></h1>
<p>	The next-best choice would have to be Python. Python is in many ways like LISP, but its syntax is more complex. This complexity can actually make it easier to understand when you're first learning it, but it means Python falls short of the ideal standard of elegance set by LISP.</p>
<h1><a name=""></a></h1>
<p>	Spend some time mastering your first language before you try another one. You will find that many of the concepts you learned will help you with your next language. After LISP and Python, I recommend trying Haskell, C, and Prolog. Haskell is a descendant of LISP with more sophisticated syntax and a beautiful type system, and prolog is a fascinating logical language which is very helpful if you ever find yourself becoming a little bored of coding. C is ubiquitous, running basically everywhere. It is pretty low-level, letting you manage your own memory and fiddle with bits. Learning it is a lesson in history as well as programming.</p>

<p>	You don't need to go to school to learn how to code. If you are teaching yourself, however, be prepared. Expect to spend considerable time and energy studying the basics. Always make sure to practice whatever new concept you're learning, and write small programs at first. You will learn more quickly and understand better by making ten small programs then by struggling to finish one gigantic one. More importantly, you'll actually enjoy coding when you have completed projects to look back on. Also, learn how to use the command-line.</p>

<p>	Learning this stuff is challenging and confusing, but it is also tremendously rewarding. Don't wait, jump in and figure things out as you go - that is the only way anyone has ever learned anything in the real world.</p>
