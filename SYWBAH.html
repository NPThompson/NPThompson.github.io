  <p>Computers are unique. Like all machines, the computer allows us to manipulate some substance more effectively than we could with our bodies, but the way it does it and the stuff it manipulates is unlike any other machine we have. Excavators move earth, and Elevators move people, but a computer moves information. Computers are hardly the only machine which sends and receives information, but unlike telephones the stuff a computer manipulates is abstract. Rather than move earth or ferment alcohol,  a unique kind of machine. Rather than manipulate something tangible, in the way an excavator manipulates earth, a computer manipulates information, which may or may not represent something tangible. Also, unlike other ( non-computerized ) machines, computers do not need constant human supervision, but follow their instructions until their task is complete. because the computer manipulates abstract stuff, it can direct or simulate other machines, even other computers. </p>

  <p>A programmer is someone who knows how to instruct computers to do these things, by giving a computer a program( instructions ), she tells them to execute the process encoded in the program. There are hundreds of 'programming languages' which we can write these programs in. Some of these processe can be complex or deal with large amounts of data, so programmers must also know techniques for managing complexity. Using these tools they can divide a process into parts, test and modify their program incrementally, and re-use the parts of their program in future programs.</p>

<p>Code and Math are both pedantic fields. To be any good at either, you will need to learn to follow a series of steps to a conclusion without skipping any of them, and be able to make very subtle distinctions. It's hard to do, especially at first, and mistakes are common. Simple mistakes, such as grammatical or spelling errors can be detected by the compiler, which will reject the program and tell you what is wrong with it. The real frustration of programming comes from bugs: those errors which neither you nor the compiler are aware of. A bug causes what we call in the vernacular 'undefined behavior'; And the compiler can't tell you when it will - or where it is.</p>

<p>Math and Code have a complementary relationship: Math is concerned with declarative, or 'what-is' knowledge. Code governs procedural, or 'how-to' knowledge. Knowing math will give you more tools and will make programming more comfortable for you, but you only need to know basic arithmetic to get started. It works the other way, too: the more code you know, the easier math will be for you. But since programs can be interacted with and visualized, programming can be easier to learn. Getting things to work in programming is typically easier, too: the proof of a program is that it works, which anyone can see, but the proof of a theorem is just as abstract as the theorem it proved.</p>

<h1>Languages and Paradigms</h1>

<p>Something else you must be aware of is that programming languages are more than a means of making machines compute results, they also shape how you think. As computer programs became larger and more complex, they exhausted our ability to comprehend them. So programmers came up with new ideas( or borrowed old ones ) for organizing their programs, and wove their ideas directly into the syntax of new languages. The ideas which a language uses to phrase the problem and suppress detail inevitably form a paradigm.  This process has been going on since the sixties, and has produced many different languages - and paradigms. </p>

  <p>The most well-known paradigms are Procedural, Object-Oriented, and Functional. There are a few others which get less attention, such as the Logical, and Imperative paradigms. Most coders have their own favorite paradigm, and flame wars over which one is best are not unheard-of. My own opinion is that the best paradigm depends on the problem to be solved, and that a good programming language should have only a few, simple constructs which can be used to program in any paradigm. LISP( short for LISt Processing ) is just such a language. </p>

  <p>I've detailed how to set up a LISP interpreter and learn the language <a href="LISP101.html">here</a>. Learning to code in LISP or any language is challenging and confusing, but it is also tremendously rewarding. Don't wait, jump in and figure things out as you go - that is the only way anyone has ever learned anything in the real world.</p>
