<p><i>"Most people find the concept of programming obvious, but the doing impossible." ~ Alan Perlis, E.O.P. 115</i></p>

<p>Programming is a skill by which you can make machines automate or simulate some process. Computer Science is a theory which models these processe. By giving a computer a program( instructions ), we tell them to execute the process encoded in the program. There are hundreds of 'programming languages' which we can write these programs in. Some of these processe can be complex or deal with large amounts of data, so programmers must also know techniques for managing complexity. Using these tools they can divide a process into parts, test and modify their program incrementally, and re-use the parts of their program in future programs.</p>

<p>Code and Math are both pedantic fields. To be any good at either, you will need to learn to follow a series of steps to a conclusion without skipping any of them, and be able to make very subtle distinctions. It's hard to do, especially at first, and mistakes are common. Simple mistakes, such as incorrect grammar or circular definitions can be detected by the compiler, which will reject the program and warn you where the error is. The real frustration of programming comes from bugs: those errors which neither you nor the compiler are aware of. A bug causes what we call in the vernacular 'undefined behavior'; And the compiler can't tell you when it will - or where it is.</p>

<p>Math and Code have a complementary relationship: Math is concerned with declarative, or 'what-is' knowledge. Code governs procedural, or 'how-to' knowledge. Knowing math will give you more tools and will make programming more comfortable for you, but you only need to know basic arithmetic to get started. It works the other way, too: the more code you know, the easier math will be for you. But since programs can be interacted with and visualized, programming can be easier to learn. Getting things to work in programming is typically easier, too: the proof of a program is that it works, which anyone can see, but the proof of a theorem is just as abstract as the theorem it proved.</p>

<h1>Languages and Paradigms</h1>

<p><i>"..start from the assumption that in every tool we create, an idea is embedded that goes beyond the function of the thing itself" ~ Neil Postman, Amusing Ourselves to Death</i></p>

<p>Something else you must be aware of is that programming languages are more than a means of making machines compute results, they also shape how you think. As computer programs became larger and more complex, they exhausted our ability to comprehend them. So programmers came up with new ideas( or borrowed old ones ) for organizing their programs, and wove their ideas directly into the syntax of new languages. The ideas which a language uses to phrase the problem and suppress detail inevitably form a paradigm.  This process has been going on since the sixties, and has produced many different languages - and paradigms. </p>

<p>The major paradigms are Logical, Functional, Imperative, Procedural, and Object-Oriented. Most coders have their own favorite paradigm, and flame wars over which one is best are not unheard-of. My own opinion is that the best paradigm depends on the problem to be solved, and that a good programming language should have only a few, simple constructs which can be used to program in any paradigm. LISP( short for LISt Processing ) is just such a language. I've detailed how to set up a LISP interpreter and learn the language <a href="LISP101.html">here</a>. Learning to code in LISP or any language is challenging and confusing, but it is also tremendously rewarding. Don't wait, jump in and figure things out as you go - that is the only way anyone has ever learned anything in the real world.</p>
