<p>*Prerequisites: Functions, Symbolic logic, Sets</p>

<p>&lambda;-calculus is a formal system for defining how function application works. The important concepts are abstraction and reduction. The greek symbol &lambda; is called lambda, and 'Calculus' in the context of &lambda;-calculus is used to mean 'a system of computation'; It has very little[1] to do with 'the calculus', which usually refers to 'the calculus of functions of real numbers'. There are variations on the notation used for &lambda;-calculus, depending on the specific application, but the concepts presented here are universal, and the notation used here should allow you to recognize &lambda;-calculus wherever it is used. </p>

<p>An abstraction in &lambda;-calculus is an expression with parameters- just like mathematical functions. The lower-case greek &lambda; is used to denote an abstraction. For example, suppose f(x,y) = x + y. Then the equivalent statement in &lambda;-calculus is &lambda;xy.x + y. Note that &lambda;-calculus is not limited to mathematical functions. It is a study of how variables are substituted into functions, and as such is really a meta-system, which can describe the rules for many different systems. For example, let AND(a,b) = a ^ b, a logical function. Then AND = &lambda;ab.a ^ b. The primitive values a and b may take on and the operations which may be performed on them are irrelevant in &lambda;-calculus; Only the rules for substitution and application. Because of this, only functions will be considered in this article. </p>

<p>capital letters A,B, ...Z, will denote entire expressions, of any complexity. lowercase letters x,y,z, will denote single variables( functions or constants ). </p>

<h1>Reduction</h1>

<p>Reduction is the process of substituting variables into &lambda;-abstractions which are being applied to arguments. There are six rules governing this process, most of which are patently obvious. The last three rules govern how to substitute a variable into an abstraction, and are more complicated than the others because of the errors which can come from variables with shared names.</p>

<p>Substitution of variables can be tricky in real-number calculus, some of these substitution problems are similar to ones in &lambda;-calculus.</p>
