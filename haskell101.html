<p>This tutorial is for anyone new to programming and any programmers new to Haskell, and assumes only that the reader has installed and can operate the Glasgow Haskell Compiler and Interpreter( GHC and GHCi ), and understands the mathematical concept of functions. I have eschewed analogy and redundant examples, trying instead to present the motivating idea, a clear conceptual explanation, and clarification of common confusions regarding each concept. The reader must understand that programming is a technical field full of dense vocabulary, and communicating these ideas is impossible without using at least some of that vocabulary. To reduce the confusion of new terms, I've made sure to introduce new concepts using only terms already familiar to the reader, and give clear definitions for new terms whenever they are introduced. </p>
