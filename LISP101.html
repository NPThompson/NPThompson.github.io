      <h1>LISP 101</h1>
<p>
LISP( Short for LISt Processor ) is the second oldest programming language still in use( FORTRAN is older ). John Mcarthy of MIT invented it as a mathematical method for representing computation. Steve Russell turned it into an actual programming language by implementing it on an IBM 704. Since then LISP has spawned many dialects, and is unique among programming languages for doing so. What makes LISP unique is that it represents data and procedures by the same structure: the list.

If you want to become a master LISP programmer( and a master programmer in general ) you'll want to go through and understand <i>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i>(SICP). It's been MIT's introductory CS course since the eighties and teaches essential concepts in CS using LISP. The SICP can be read online( for free! ) <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">here</a>, and recorded lectures can be found <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/">here</a>.
