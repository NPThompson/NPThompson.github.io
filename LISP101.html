      <h1>LISP 101</h1>
<p>
  LISP( Short for LISt Processor ) is the second oldest programming language still in use( FORTRAN is older ). John Mcarthy of MIT invented it as a math for representing computation. Steve Russell turned it into an actual programming language by implementing it on an IBM 704. To fully understand LISP takes some time and effort, but in a nutshell, LISP is special because:
</p>

 <p>
<ul>
  <li>
    #1.) it has a simple universal interpreter, 'eval', which itself is written in LISP.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    #2.) LISP represents everything( program source code, procedures, simple data) by one structure, the cons-pair.
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
#3.) Because of the previous two properties, LISP programs can operate on LISP programs and imbed new language features easily.</li>

  </ul>
</p>

If you want to become a master LISP programmer( and a master programmer in general ) you'll want to go through and understand <i>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i>(SICP). It's been MIT's introductory CS course since the eighties and teaches essential concepts in CS using LISP. The SICP can be <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">read online</a>(for free!), and there are <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/video-lectures/">lectures</a> from it which you can watch online or download. If you're still unconvinced, try the opinion of <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/lisp.html">Paul Graham</a>, an experienced LISP programmer who, along with Robert Morris, relied on LISP to develop a highly successful web-based service, Viaweb.
